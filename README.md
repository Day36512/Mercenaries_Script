# Mercenaries Script by Dinkledork
This script is currently being adapted and is designed to create a custom event in AzerothCore, where players can interact with specific NPCs (defined by the NPC_IDS list) using a gossip menu. The event requires players to have a particular item (ITEM_ID) in their inventory. When the player initiates a gossip interaction with the NPC, the NPC will say a random battle cry, equip a random two-handed weapon from the predefined list (mainHandItems), and move to a random destination chosen from a set of predefined locations (destinations). This script will be adapted as a sort of city attacker script where players can hire mercenaries to attack predetermined areas with npcs. Could be used in BG type scenarios or to create RP events like Hillsbrad PvP. Originally I wrote this script for a Scourge event quest on my server where they attack crossroads and the player has to pass out armaments to npcs and send them to specified locations. Now I'll be adapting it so the player will have a list of gossip options allowing them to choose equiped weapons. Npc abilities will also be scripted based on the weapons the player chooses. Then it's just a matter of adding additional gossip options to have npcs attack specific areas, which people would have to figure out on their own, but still.
